# IRIS_PREDICTION_WEBAPP
With ML we classify Iris Species


It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.


# The columns in this dataset are:

  Id<br>
  SepalLengthCm<br>
  SepalWidthCm<br>
  PetalLengthCm<br>
  PetalWidthCm<br>
  Species<br>


The use of this data set in cluster analysis however is not common, since the data set only contains two clusters with rather obvious separation. One of the clusters contains Iris setosa, while the other cluster contains both Iris virginica and Iris versicolor and is not separable without the species information Fisher used. This makes the data set a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining
